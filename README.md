# Hi Everyone!

My name is `Kiatbordin Jumratanet` or you can call me `KEN`.

👨‍🎓 I’m currently learning in the Junior Software Developer#2 Bootcamp at Generation Thailand.

🌍 I have a background as a Network engineer in ISP and e-commerce online shopping platform companies.

🏆 My goal is to transition the transferable skills acquired from my experiences and recent training to a new role as a Software Developer where I can utilize my background in technology, infrastructure, and operation.

Feel free to reach out to me ==> [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiatbordin-jumratanet/).
