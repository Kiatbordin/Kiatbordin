# Hi Everyone!

My name is `Kiatbordin Jumratanet` or you can call me `KEN`.

🌍 I have a background as a Network engineer in ISP and e-commerce online shopping platform companies.

🏆 My goal is to enhance the technical skills acquired from my experiences and recent training to a role in the Tech development industry where I can utilize my background in technology, infrastructure, network and operation.
